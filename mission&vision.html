<center><h2>Our Mission</h2></center>
<p>"Our mission is to create positive change and uplift underprivileged communities in Bangladesh. We are committed to empowering individuals by providing access to education, healthcare, and essential resources. Through collaborative efforts and sustainable solutions, we aim to foster a brighter future for all." Our main mission is:</p>

   <h4><p> 1. Education program.</p></h4>
   <H4><p> 2. Health program.</p></h4>
   <h4><p> 3. Social devlopment.</p></h4>


<center><p><h3>1. Education program:</h3> The education system for underprivileged kids plays a crucial role in addressing the educational inequities that exist in society. It aims to provide equal access to quality education and opportunities for children who come from disadvantaged backgrounds.We provide free education to underprivileged students.  So that they can study.  Don't fall behind in society.  We also provide them with online education.  So that they can acquire knowledge from the best teachers of the country.  We want every child to become a good citizen of the country.Today's child is tomorrow's future.  So our aim is to cover underprivileged children's education.  We provide education to underprivileged, neglected children of the country.  They should not be neglected.  It is our wish that their future should be bright.</p></center>
<center><p><h3>2. healthcare program:</h3>Medical care is a fundamental right of every human being.  But currently, there are many underprivileged people who do not get proper medical care because they do not have enough money.  As a result, they cannot receive proper treatment.  Again, many people do not want to receive medical care properly due to being uneducated.  As a result, a part of the country's people suffer from illness.  We make them aware about medical services and to provide proper treatment.  We give them a chance to visit the doctor for free.The doctor comes on a certain day.  And writes prescriptions after observing those patients.  Volunteers help in this work.  Next we dispense the medicine as per the prescription.It helps the underprivileged people a lot.  They don't have to spend money separately.  We want to build a beautiful and healthy Bangladesh</p></center>
<center><p><h3>3. Social devlopment:</h3>To empower women in the society, ASUS provides various trainings including tailoring training.  Here underprivileged women can develop themselves through free tailoring training.  Now many women are able to earn their own money by taking tailoring training.  Many neglected women in the society are abused in various ways in husband's house and father's house.  For them to bear the cost themselves, ASUS started two trainings.  And progressing successfully.  The women of the society should not be neglected.ASUS is playing an important role in the social development of women, advancing, empowering and improving the social status and opportunities available to women in the society.  It aims to combat gender-based discrimination, promote gender equality and ensure women's equal access to resources, rights and opportunities.  Here are some important aspects of women's social </p></center>
